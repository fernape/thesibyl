- Using libevent in sibyl_srv.c
- New protocol:
  [C];....
  Where C is:
  '-' -> send public keys
  'a' where '0'<=a<='9'
      -> transform from default key to 'a' what I am sending
  ''  -> default operation with default key
- Keys are named
  decrypt
  decrypt0 (both are the same)
  decryptX (1<=X<=9)
  sign
  sign0 (both are the same)
  signX (1<=X<=9)
